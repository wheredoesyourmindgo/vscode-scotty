# Scotty

Scotty is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to quickly jump to and select specific characters or sequences of characters within your code. You can perform these jumps either case-sensitively or case-insensitively, and you have the option to select text as you jump.

- Jump forward or backward to a specific character or sequence of characters.
- Select text as you jump forward or backward.
- Perform jumps case-sensitively or case-insensitively.
- Easily reset the jump state by changing the selection, document, or active editor.
